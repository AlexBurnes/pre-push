## What's Left to Build
- **Git hook installation**: Complete the install command for automatic hook management
- **Advanced features**: Environment variables, matrix support, conditional execution
- **Performance optimization**: Optimize for large repositories and complex dependency graphs
- **Cross-platform testing**: Test builds on Windows and macOS platforms
- **CI/CD pipeline testing**: Test GitHub Actions workflows in actual CI environment
- **Documentation improvements**: Add more examples and use cases

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Git hook installation**: Install command not yet implemented (placeholder only)
- **Version library integration**: ✅ COMPLETED - Integrated with `github.com/AlexBurnes/version-go/pkg/version` v0.8.22
- **Scripts directory**: Some scripts still reference 'version' instead of 'pre-push'
- **Cross-platform testing**: Only tested on Linux, needs Windows/macOS validation
- **Performance**: Not yet optimized for very large repositories with many files
- **Advanced features**: Environment variables, conditional execution, matrix support not implemented
- **Legacy bash dependency**: src/ directory still contains old bash scripts (for reference only)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
**Initial Analysis (Current):**
- Identified need to modernize bash-based pre-push implementation
- Decided on Go as replacement language for cross-platform compatibility
- Chose YAML configuration format for familiarity and flexibility
- Selected DAG-based execution for performance improvements
- Maintained existing build system (CMake + Conan + GoReleaser) for consistency

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **Layered architecture**: Clear separation between CLI, library, and internal packages
- **DAG execution**: Parallel processing with explicit dependency management
- **Error policies**: Configurable stop/warn behavior per check step
- **Variable interpolation**: GitHub-style syntax for dynamic configuration
- **Self-installing**: Automatic Git hook management for seamless integration

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Go 1.22+**: Modern Go features with CGO disabled for static binaries
- **Minimal dependencies**: Prefer standard library, avoid heavy frameworks
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing with race detection
- **Reproducible builds**: Deterministic builds with proper toolchain management
