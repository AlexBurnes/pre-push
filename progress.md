- **COMPLETED: Buildfab v0.7.2 Integration with Step Output**: 
  - Upgraded from v0.5.0 to v0.7.2 for enhanced step output capabilities
  - Implemented buildfab.SimpleRunner for clean step-by-step execution
  - Fixed duplicate error output by removing redundant error printing
  - Achieved professional step output with proper status icons and summaries
  - Maintained single stage execution as requested (not individual action execution)
  - Fixed version-module action version format mismatch between binary and scripts
  - Resolved template variable resolution issues by using direct script calls
  - Maintained full compatibility with existing .project.yml configuration format
- **COMPLETED: Enhanced version flag handling**: -V outputs only version, --version outputs full info
- **COMPLETED: Bin directory support**: Project configuration supports custom module locations
- **COMPLETED: Flexible version validation**: Shell script approach using scripts/version modules
- **COMPLETED: Language-agnostic test execution**: Support for any test command via `run:` actions
- **COMPLETED: Conditional execution framework**: Support for `only` and `if` conditions in step configuration
- **COMPLETED: Project settings integration**: Updated .project.yml to use scripts/version utility for version validation
- **COMPLETED: Version checking actions**: version-check and version-greatest actions now use scripts/version commands
- **COMPLETED: PRD parallel execution improvements**: 
  - Ordered output display (steps shown in project.yml declaration order) - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Continue running independent steps on failure - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Add SKIPPED status for dependent steps - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Enhanced error reporting and summary - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Streaming output that displays results as they complete - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Dependency-aware display that waits for required steps - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## What's Left to Build
- **Git hook installation**: Complete the install command for automatic hook management
- **Advanced features**: Environment variables, matrix support, conditional execution
- **Performance optimization**: Optimize for large repositories and complex dependency graphs
- **Cross-platform testing**: Test builds on Windows and macOS platforms
- **CI/CD pipeline testing**: Test GitHub Actions workflows in actual CI environment
- **Documentation improvements**: Add more examples and use cases

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Git hook installation**: Install command not yet implemented (placeholder only)
- **Version library integration**: ✅ COMPLETED - Integrated with `github.com/AlexBurnes/version-go/pkg/version` v0.8.22
- **Scripts directory**: Some scripts still reference 'version' instead of 'pre-push'
- **Cross-platform testing**: Only tested on Linux, needs Windows/macOS validation
- **Performance**: Not yet optimized for very large repositories with many files
- **Advanced features**: Environment variables, conditional execution, matrix support not implemented
- **Legacy bash dependency**: src/ directory still contains old bash scripts (for reference only)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
**Initial Analysis (Current):**
- Identified need to modernize bash-based pre-push implementation
- Decided on Go as replacement language for cross-platform compatibility
- Chose YAML configuration format for familiarity and flexibility
- Selected DAG-based execution for performance improvements
- Maintained existing build system (CMake + Conan + GoReleaser) for consistency

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **Layered architecture**: Clear separation between CLI, library, and internal packages
- **DAG execution**: Parallel processing with explicit dependency management
- **Error policies**: Configurable stop/warn behavior per check step
- **Variable interpolation**: GitHub-style syntax for dynamic configuration
- **Self-installing**: Automatic Git hook management for seamless integration

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Go 1.22+**: Modern Go features with CGO disabled for static binaries
- **Minimal dependencies**: Prefer standard library, avoid heavy frameworks
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing with race detection
- **Reproducible builds**: Deterministic builds with proper toolchain management
