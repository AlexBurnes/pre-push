# Progress: pre-push

## What Works
- **Complete core implementation**: All essential functionality implemented and working
- **All tests passing**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% test coverage and race detection
- **Version management**: Proper version bumping and changelog maintenance
- **Build and packaging system**: GoReleaser dry-run successful with all platform binaries generated
- **Cross-platform builds**: Linux amd64/arm64, macOS amd64/arm64, Windows amd64/arm64 binaries
- **Package manager integration**: Homebrew formula and Scoop manifest generated correctly
- **CI/CD workflows**: GitHub Actions workflows properly configured and DRY-compliant
- **Version management**: Fixed hardcoded version issues, proper version utility integration
- **Project configuration**: All buildtools scripts and GoReleaser config updated for pre-push
- **Built-in Git actions**: git@untracked, git@uncommitted, git@modified with real Git operations
- **Custom action execution**: Full shell command execution for run: actions with verbose output
- **Variable interpolation**: Complete ${{ }} syntax with Git tag/branch detection and resolution
- **DAG executor**: Full dependency-based execution with cycle detection and topological sorting
- **UI system**: Complete colored output, status reporting, progress display, and error formatting with conditional coloring
- **Enhanced error messages**: Improved built-in action error messages with inline reproduction commands and clean formatting
- **Better user experience**: CLI utility name, version, and project information displayed at start of pre-push hook
- **Git hook integration**: Proper argument parsing that ignores Git arguments and reads ref info from stdin
- **Configuration system**: YAML parsing, validation, and variable resolution working correctly
- **CLI interface**: All commands (test, list-uses, --version, --help) fully functional
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests with race detection
- **Error handling**: Complete error policies with stop/warn behavior and proper reporting
- **Git integration**: Real Git repository operations for status checking and variable detection
- **Cross-platform support**: Working on Linux with proper Go module structure
- **Documentation**: Complete memory bank and project documentation
- **COMPLETED: Enhanced version flag handling**: -V outputs only version, --version outputs full info
- **COMPLETED: Bin directory support**: Project configuration supports custom module locations
- **COMPLETED: Flexible version validation**: Shell script approach using scripts/version modules
- **COMPLETED: Language-agnostic test execution**: Support for any test command via `run:` actions
- **COMPLETED: Conditional execution framework**: Support for `only` and `if` conditions in step configuration

## What's Left to Build
- **Git hook installation**: Complete the install command for automatic hook management
- **Advanced features**: Environment variables, matrix support, conditional execution
- **Performance optimization**: Optimize for large repositories and complex dependency graphs
- **Cross-platform testing**: Test builds on Windows and macOS platforms
- **CI/CD pipeline testing**: Test GitHub Actions workflows in actual CI environment
- **Documentation improvements**: Add more examples and use cases

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Git hook installation**: Install command not yet implemented (placeholder only)
- **Version library integration**: version-go library integration not yet complete
- **Scripts directory**: Some scripts still reference 'version' instead of 'pre-push'
- **Cross-platform testing**: Only tested on Linux, needs Windows/macOS validation
- **Performance**: Not yet optimized for very large repositories with many files
- **Advanced features**: Environment variables, conditional execution, matrix support not implemented
- **Legacy bash dependency**: src/ directory still contains old bash scripts (for reference only)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
**Initial Analysis (Current):**
- Identified need to modernize bash-based pre-push implementation
- Decided on Go as replacement language for cross-platform compatibility
- Chose YAML configuration format for familiarity and flexibility
- Selected DAG-based execution for performance improvements
- Maintained existing build system (CMake + Conan + GoReleaser) for consistency

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **Layered architecture**: Clear separation between CLI, library, and internal packages
- **DAG execution**: Parallel processing with explicit dependency management
- **Error policies**: Configurable stop/warn behavior per check step
- **Variable interpolation**: GitHub-style syntax for dynamic configuration
- **Self-installing**: Automatic Git hook management for seamless integration

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Go 1.22+**: Modern Go features with CGO disabled for static binaries
- **Minimal dependencies**: Prefer standard library, avoid heavy frameworks
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing with race detection
- **Reproducible builds**: Deterministic builds with proper toolchain management
