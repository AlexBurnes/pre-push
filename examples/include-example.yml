# Example buildfab configuration demonstrating the include feature
# This shows how to organize complex configurations into smaller, manageable files

project:
  name: "include-example"

# Include external configuration files
include:
  - actions/common.yml     # Common actions used across stages
  - actions/test.yml       # Testing-related actions
  - actions/build.yml      # Build-related actions
  - stages/ci.yml          # CI/CD stages
  - stages/dev.yml         # Development stages

# Main configuration can also define actions and stages
actions:
  - name: main-action
    run: echo "This is the main action defined in the root config"

stages:
  main:
    steps:
      - action: main-action
      - action: common-setup  # From actions/common.yml
      - action: test          # From actions/test.yml
      - action: build         # From actions/build.yml
