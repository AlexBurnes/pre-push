# Buildfab Executor Issue Report

## ✅ RESOLVED
This issue has been resolved in buildfab v0.5.1. The project has been updated to use the fixed version.

## Problem (Historical)
The buildfab executor was failing with "stage execution not yet implemented" error when trying to run stages.

## Error Details
```
Error: stage execution not yet implemented
```

## Failing Code Example
The issue occurs in `internal/exec/buildfab_executor.go` in the `RunStage` method:

```go
// RunStage executes a specific stage using buildfab DAG executor
func (e *BuildfabExecutor) RunStage(ctx context.Context, stageName string) error {
    // ... setup code ...
    
    // Convert pre-push config to buildfab config
    buildfabConfig := e.convertToBuildfabConfig()
    
    // Create buildfab runner
    runner := buildfab.NewRunner(buildfabConfig, opts)

    // Execute using buildfab - THIS LINE FAILS
    err := runner.RunStage(ctx, stageName)
    
    // ... rest of method ...
}
```

## Root Cause
The `buildfab.Runner.RunStage()` method exists but returns "stage execution not yet implemented" error, indicating the method is not fully implemented in the buildfab library.

## Expected Behavior
The `RunStage` method should execute the specified stage and return an error if execution fails.

## Current Workaround
Switched to using the regular `exec.Executor` instead of `exec.BuildfabExecutor` in `cmd/pre-push/main.go`:

```go
// Changed from:
executor := exec.NewBuildfabExecutor(cfg, ui)

// To:
executor := exec.New(cfg, ui)
```

## Files Affected
- `internal/exec/buildfab_executor.go` - Contains the failing implementation
- `cmd/pre-push/main.go` - Uses the buildfab executor
- `.project.yml` - Configuration that triggers the stage execution

## Test Case
```bash
cd /home/burnes/projects/burnes/go/pre-push
./bin/pre-push test
```

## Minimal Reproduction
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/AlexBurnes/buildfab/pkg/buildfab"
)

func main() {
    config := &buildfab.Config{}
    config.Project.Name = "test-project"
    config.Actions = []buildfab.Action{
        {Name: "test-action", Run: "echo 'Hello from buildfab'"},
    }
    config.Stages = map[string]buildfab.Stage{
        "test-stage": {
            Steps: []buildfab.Step{{Action: "test-action"}},
        },
    }
    
    opts := buildfab.DefaultRunOptions()
    runner := buildfab.NewRunner(config, opts)
    
    err := runner.RunStage(context.Background(), "test-stage")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("❌ RunStage failed: %v\n", err)
    }
}
```

**Output:** `❌ RunStage failed: stage execution not yet implemented`

## Buildfab Library Integration
The project is trying to integrate with:
- `github.com/AlexBurnes/buildfab` v0.5.0
- Using `buildfab.NewRunner()` and `runner.RunStage()`

## Resolution
The issue was fixed in buildfab v0.5.1. The project has been updated to use the new version:

```bash
go get github.com/AlexBurnes/buildfab@v0.5.1
```

## Verification
The buildfab executor now works correctly:
```bash
./bin/pre-push test
# ✅ Stage 'pre-push' completed successfully
```

## Additional Context
The pre-push tool is designed to use buildfab as the core DAG execution engine, but currently falls back to the regular executor due to this issue. The buildfab integration is important for advanced workflow features and parallel execution capabilities.
