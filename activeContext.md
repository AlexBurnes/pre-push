# Active Context: pre-push

## Current Work Focus
**Core Implementation Complete - Enhanced with Flexible Configuration**
- All core functionality implemented and tested

- **COMPLETED**: Enhanced version flag handling (-V outputs only version, --version outputs full info)
- **COMPLETED**: Added bin directory support for project configuration
- **COMPLETED**: Implemented flexible shell script approach for version module validation
- **COMPLETED**: Removed rigid built-in actions in favor of project-specific configuration

## Recent Changes
- **Version bump to v1.1.0**: Enhanced version handling and flexible configuration support
- **Fixed version flags**: -V now outputs only version, --version outputs full module info
- **Added bin directory support**: Project configuration now supports bin directory for module location
- **Implemented flexible version validation**: Replaced rigid built-in action with shell script approach
- **Enhanced project configuration**: Added support for project-specific version checking using scripts/version modules
- **Removed unnecessary complexity**: Eliminated version@check-modules-version built-in action
- **Updated project settings**: Modified .project.yml to use scripts/version utility for version-check and version-greatest actions
- **Improved version validation**: Project configuration now uses scripts/version-check and scripts/version greatest commands
- **Fixed test compilation errors**: Added missing UI interface methods to mockUI test struct to resolve compilation failures
- **All tests passing**: Verified all tests pass with race detection enabled (go test ./... -v -race)
- **Improved pre-push hook output**: Enhanced output to show CLI utility name, version, and project information at start
- **Better error message formatting**: Improved built-in action error messages with inline reproduction commands
- **Enhanced user experience**: Error messages now show "to manually check run:" with properly indented git commands
- **Cleaner error output**: Removed unwanted Usage information when built-in actions fail
- **Consistent error formatting**: All built-in actions now use 4-space indentation and simple git commands
- **Fixed Git hook argument parsing**: Corrected argument parsing to ignore Git arguments and read from stdin when called by Git
- **Improved hook detection**: Enhanced detection logic to distinguish between manual commands and Git hook calls
- **Improved UI coloring**: Enhanced stage headers, stage results, and summary with conditional coloring
- **Better visual feedback**: Items with count > 0 get colored, items with count = 0 show in gray
- **Professional appearance**: Stage headers in cyan, success in green, errors in red, warnings in yellow
- **Fixed GitHub Actions workflows**: Updated CI and release workflows to use 'pre-push' instead of 'version'
- **Implemented DRY principle**: Replaced inline code in CI workflow with proper buildtools script calls
- **Improved workflow consistency**: Both CI and release workflows now use the same buildtools scripts
- **Enhanced maintainability**: Reduced code duplication and improved workflow readability
- **Fixed build and packaging system**: Updated all buildtools scripts and GoReleaser configuration for pre-push project
- **Corrected version management**: Fixed hardcoded version in check-version-status script to use current version from utility
- **Updated project references**: Changed all "version" references to "pre-push" in build scripts and configuration
- **Fixed CMakeLists.txt**: Removed broken bootstrap-version target and corrected dependencies
- **Updated GoReleaser config**: Fixed project name, binary paths, URLs, and test commands for pre-push
- **Successfully tested builds**: GoReleaser dry-run completed successfully with all platform binaries
- **Validated packaging**: Generated archives, Homebrew formula, and Scoop manifest correctly
- **Implemented built-in Git actions**: Complete implementation of git@untracked, git@uncommitted, git@modified with actual Git operations
- **Added action interface**: Full Runner interface with Run, GetRepro, GetHelp, GetName methods
- **Implemented custom actions**: Complete shell command execution for run: actions with verbose output
- **Added variable interpolation**: Full ${{ }} syntax support with Git tag/branch detection
- **Implemented UI package**: Complete colored output, status reporting, and progress display
- **Created comprehensive tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests with race detection
- **Tested complete workflow**: End-to-end testing with real Git repositories and configuration
- **Fixed configuration**: Corrected typos in .project.yml and created working sample configuration
- **Validated CLI interface**: All commands (test, list-uses, --version, --help) working correctly

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Git hook installation**: Complete the install command for automatic hook management
2. **Add advanced features**: Environment variables, matrix support, conditional execution
3. **Cross-platform testing**: Test builds on Windows and macOS platforms
4. **Performance optimization**: Optimize for large repositories and complex dependency graphs
5. **CI/CD pipeline testing**: Test GitHub Actions workflows in actual CI environment
6. **Documentation improvements**: Add more examples and use cases

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Directory structure**: Following Go conventions with cmd/, pkg/, internal/ layout
- **Dependency management**: Using Go modules with minimal external dependencies
- **Configuration format**: YAML-based config similar to GitHub Actions for familiarity
- **Error handling**: Implementing both stop and warn policies for different check types
- **Build system**: Maintaining existing CMake + Conan + GoReleaser setup for consistency
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensuring smooth migration from existing bash scripts
- **COMPLETED: Language agnostic design**: Test execution via `run:` actions, not built-ins
- **COMPLETED: Flexible version validation**: Shell script approach using project-specific configuration
- **COMPLETED: Enhanced version flags**: -V outputs only version, --version outputs full info
- **COMPLETED: Bin directory support**: Project configuration supports custom module locations
- **COMPLETED: Output suppression**: Custom actions run quietly, show only status

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Go coding standards**: 4-space indentation, 120-char line limit, comprehensive documentation
- **Error handling**: Explicit error handling with context wrapping using fmt.Errorf
- **Concurrency**: Using errgroup and context for parallel execution
- **Configuration**: YAML with variable interpolation using ${{ }} syntax
- **CLI design**: Consistent with existing tools (--version, -h, -d, -v flags)
- **Testing**: Table-driven tests with comprehensive coverage

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Git integration complexity**: Git status parsing requires careful handling of porcelain format and status codes
- **DAG execution challenges**: Cycle detection and topological sorting are critical for proper dependency management
- **Variable interpolation**: GitHub-style ${{ }} syntax provides familiar and flexible configuration
- **Testing with Git**: Real Git repository testing requires careful setup and cleanup of temporary directories
- **CLI design patterns**: Cobra framework provides excellent structure for complex CLI applications
- **Error handling**: Context-aware error handling with proper wrapping is essential for debugging
- **Concurrency safety**: Race detection testing revealed the importance of proper synchronization
- **Configuration validation**: Comprehensive validation prevents runtime errors and improves user experience
