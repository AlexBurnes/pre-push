5. **Performance optimization**: Optimize for large repositories and complex dependency graphs
6. **CI/CD pipeline testing**: Test GitHub Actions workflows in actual CI environment
7. **Documentation improvements**: Add more examples and use cases

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Directory structure**: Following Go conventions with cmd/, pkg/, internal/ layout
- **Dependency management**: Using Go modules with minimal external dependencies
- **Configuration format**: YAML-based config similar to GitHub Actions for familiarity
- **Error handling**: Implementing both stop and warn policies for different check types
- **Build system**: Maintaining existing CMake + Conan + GoReleaser setup for consistency
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensuring smooth migration from existing bash scripts
- **COMPLETED: Language agnostic design**: Test execution via `run:` actions, not built-ins
- **COMPLETED: Flexible version validation**: Shell script approach using project-specific configuration
- **COMPLETED: Enhanced version flags**: -V outputs only version, --version outputs full info
- **COMPLETED: Bin directory support**: Project configuration supports custom module locations
- **COMPLETED: Output suppression**: Custom actions run quietly, show only status

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Go coding standards**: 4-space indentation, 120-char line limit, comprehensive documentation
- **Error handling**: Explicit error handling with context wrapping using fmt.Errorf
- **Concurrency**: Using errgroup and context for parallel execution
- **Configuration**: YAML with variable interpolation using ${{ }} syntax
- **CLI design**: Consistent with existing tools (--version, -h, -d, -v flags)
- **Testing**: Table-driven tests with comprehensive coverage

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Git integration complexity**: Git status parsing requires careful handling of porcelain format and status codes
- **DAG execution challenges**: Cycle detection and topological sorting are critical for proper dependency management
- **Variable interpolation**: GitHub-style ${{ }} syntax provides familiar and flexible configuration
- **Testing with Git**: Real Git repository testing requires careful setup and cleanup of temporary directories
- **CLI design patterns**: Cobra framework provides excellent structure for complex CLI applications
- **Error handling**: Context-aware error handling with proper wrapping is essential for debugging
- **Concurrency safety**: Race detection testing revealed the importance of proper synchronization
- **Configuration validation**: Comprehensive validation prevents runtime errors and improves user experience
