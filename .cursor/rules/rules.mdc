# Project RULES (Go + Releasing + Docs + Tests)

## Scope
- Project: CLI `version` (Git describe-like).
- Code: Go (>=1.22/1.23), CGO disabled for reproducible static builds.
- Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, windows/amd64, windows/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64.

## General Engineering
- Keep functions short and cohesive; prefer composition over inheritance.
- No global mutable state; pass dependencies explicitly.
- Handle errors explicitly; user-facing messages must be helpful.
- Log minimally for CLI (stderr), keep stdout for machine-readable output if flags require it.

## Style & Tooling
- `gofmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint` (default presets; no nitpicking rules that block progress).
- Naming: exported symbols with doc comments (`// Name ...`), internal packages without stutter.
- Avoid external deps unless justified; prefer stdlib.
- No panics in normal control flow.

## Tests
- Unit tests for formatting/edge cases/fallbacks.
- Table-driven tests, no sleeping/timing unless necessary.
- CI: run `go test ./... -race`.
- Aim for practical coverage (≥70% in formatting/logic pkgs).

## Docs
- Each exported symbol documented.
- `README.md`: what, how to install (Scoop + tar.gz install.sh), usage examples, versioning policy.
- `/docs/RELEASE.md`: manual release steps + how to recover a failed release.
- ADRs in `/docs/adr` and mirrored in MPC (memory-base).
- **CHANGELOG.md**: MANDATORY update for ANY documentation or code changes (see rule-changelog.mdc).

## Versioning & Git
- SemVer, tags like `vX.Y.Z`.
- Branching: feature branches → PR → squash merge.
- Commit style (suggested): Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
- Tag only from green CI.

## Build/Release
- **Build tools**: buildfab can build pre-push using its configuration
- **Build stages**: Use `buildfab run pre-check`, `buildfab run pre-install`, `buildfab run build`, `buildfab run test`, `buildfab run release`
- **Tool checking**: Automatic verification of required tools (conan, cmake, goreleaser, go, version utility, pre-push utility)
- **Tool installation**: Automatic installation of missing tools via pre-install stage
- **GoReleaser integration**: Use GoReleaser (see `.goreleaser.yml`) for release automation
- **Cross-platform packaging**: Windows: Scoop (own bucket), Linux: tar.gz archive + `packaging/linux/install.sh`
- **Reproducible builds**: Artifacts must be reproducible: `-ldflags="-s -w ..."`; include build metadata via ldflags

## Cursor + MPC (memory-base)
- ALWAYS consult MPC for rules/specs before coding (see `.cursor/mpc-usage.md`).
- If rules missing/ambiguous: write ADR proposal in `/docs/adr`, sync to MPC `decisions/*`.
- After changes to rules/spec: update `.cursor/rules.md`, `/docs`, and MPC.
- PR descriptions must include:
  - What changed and why.
  - Links to MPC entries and ADRs (if any).

## Complete Changes Shortcut
- When user writes "complete changes" (or variations), automatically execute full release workflow
- See `rule-complete-changes.mdc` for detailed workflow and shortcuts
- Includes: version bump, memory bank updates, documentation updates, git operations, and push

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- Lint & tests pass.
- CLI help accurate.
- Docs updated (README, RELEASE, ADR if needed).
- **CHANGELOG.md updated** (MANDATORY for any changes).
- MPC updated (decisions/changelog).
- GoReleaser dry-run successful.

## Security & Licenses
- No vendoring secrets.
- Respect licenses; include LICENSE file.
